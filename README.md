# Go Concurrency [Video]
This is the code repository for [Go Concurrency [Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/go-concurrency-video?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781788394161), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
Go is a multi-paradigm programming language that has built-in facilities for creating concurrent applications. Design patterns allow developers to efficiently address common problems faced during developing applications. 
The focus in this course is on learning about concurrent structures and parallel execution. You will use the majority of Go primitives to write concurrent apps, and we will develop some classical design patterns with concurrent structures to maximize parallelism. Also, you will learn some typical structures with which to develop concurrent apps in Go. You will learn how a classical pattern can become more complex if you need it to work in a concurrent way; however, the idea is to understand Go concurrent primitives so that you know how to write your own concurrent design patterns by using the knowledge taken from the course.
